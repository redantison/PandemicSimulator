    "# General epidemic simulation with super-spreaders, extinguishing events, quarantine, and multiple outbreak centers\n",
    " by Roger Ison, roger@miximum.info\n",
    "\n",
    "  Outbreaks are represented with a reasonably standard \"SIR\" (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model.\n",
    "The idea is that you have an initial population of uninfected but susceptible individuals, and a small\n",
    "number of initially infected individuals. Disease spreads from each infected indivdidual to some number\n",
    "of susceptible ones at a rate R0. If R0 > 1 the outbreak will explode; if < 1 it will extinguish. \n",
    "The simulation proceeds in cycles of fixed duration. Some number of infected cases die; the rest recover.\n",
    "Recovered individuals can't be re-infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note that R0 is the \"naive population\" spread rate, when almost everybody is uninfected. When herd immunity\n",
    "is enabled in the model, then the spread rate is reduced according to the population proportion of uninfected indivduals.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The model proceeds in cycles, discussed below. On each cycle, the currently infected individuals infect\n",
    "some number of new cases, while going on themselves to either recover or die. If modeling multiple, simultaneous\n",
    "outbreaks, the cycles of all the outbreaks are synchronized as simulated time proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling super-spreaders\n",
    "  This simulation goes beyond basic exponential math by modeling \"super-spreaders\". While R0 is the average\n",
    "transmission rate, for every infected individual we draw a spread rate from a log-normal distribution having a\n",
    "mean of R0 with some specified dispersion. As a result, some infected cases spread to a large number of new victims,\n",
    "while others spread virtually not at all - that is the nature of log-normal distributions.\n",
    "Therefore, the outcome of a simulation is stochastic in the log-normal spread rate. The sim runs multiple \n",
    "trials with the same parameters to get an idea of the range of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  See here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution  to learn about log-normal distributions.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Modeling extinction events\n",
    "  The model allows to specify an \"extinction event\" which occurs at a specified cycle number. The \n",
    "extinction event, if present, changes the underlying spread rate R0 to a new, specified number. If it is\n",
    "less than 1.0, the epidemic will eventually die out. Extinction events might include an effective medication;\n",
    "introduction of a vaccine; or a partially effective quarantine.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Of course, if the model includes herd immunity then the outbreak will also extinguish before everyone gets\n",
    "infected. In this case, the extinction event need not reduce R0 below 1.0; even a small positive number like\n",
    "1.1 will still yield improved outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling herd immunity\n",
    "  If this feature is enabled in the model parameters, then the effective spread rate will be reduced as the\n",
    "number of recovered individuals grows. The scale of reduction of R0 is the proportion of uninfected individuals\n",
    "to uninfectable individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple outbreak centers\n",
    "  The model supports creating multiple, communicating outbreak centers in geographically dispersed populations.\n",
    "A small proportion of population is modeled to move between each pair of centers. Outbreak centers can be created \n",
    "either randomly in the area of a 2D circle around the initial, root outbreak; or along a line, with the spacing \n",
    "between centers increasing by powers of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The proportion of population who travel, or the probability of travel in each direction, is defined as an \n",
    "exponentially declining function of distance; the decay rate or scale of distahnce is a parameter of the simulation.\n",
    "In the model, the proportion of individuals who travel is selected; some are infected, some are not. The infected\n",
    "individuals contribute to spread where they visit; the uninfected ones may become infected where they visit, and\n",
    "then return home. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Because the number of travelers is generally small, infected travelers are not assumed to spend\n",
    "the entire cycle where they visit; they may contribute to infection both at home and abroad. This could be \n",
    "regarded as an imperfection in the simulation's bookkeeping. Moreover, no accounting is made as to whether\n",
    "traveling individuals might visit more than one other outbreak center. These bookkeeping details are probably\n",
    "unimportant to the final outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The purpose of this feature is not to emulate any specific geographical map, but to observe the delays \n",
    "between outbreaks, and other pandemic behaviors, and also the effects of regional quarantines (which are not\n",
    "as effective as one might hope).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling travel quarantine\n",
    "  The model allows imposition of a strict quarantine that blocks travel between geographically separated\n",
    "outbreak centers. This is intended to help understand the effect of such policies. The quarantine does NOT\n",
    "operate within individual outbreak centers; use the extinction events for that.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  By playing with the simulation's basic parameters, you can get a numerical sense of how a real epidemic might \n",
    "play out. If you adjust them to track reported case numbers, you can estimate how long it might be before burn-out,\n",
    "how many cases and deaths may occur, and the impact of a vaccine coming available."

    "# Structure of the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "  Each outbreak is represented by an \"Outbreak\" class object. Being Python objects, outbreaks execute slowly compared\n",
    "to compiled code. An outbreak begins with a fixed population of 10 million unless you edit the code. One outbreak is the ROOT, \n",
    "where initial infection occurs. All other outbreaks start with no infections. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Each step of an outbreak is implemented by calling the OneCycle() method. OneCycle() does the bookkeeping of generating\n",
    "new infections from the current active infections, and recovering or killing off the current active infections.\n",
    "The number of individuals in the uninfected, infected, recovered, and dead pools is recorded after each cycle step.\n",
    "For multi-center outbreaks, each cycle has two phases. First, the number of travelers is determined, both infected\n",
    "and uninfected. These are recorded in Outbreak object local variables. Then OneCycle() determines\n",
    "the new numbers of individuals in the SIR pools. During multi-center simulations, OneCycle() calls other methods to\n",
    "pass traveler infection consequences back to the various Outbreak objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This architecture is a compromise between agent-based modeling and simple differential equations. An agent based\n",
    "model would have many more parameters and distributions, such as the likelihood that one agent will encounter another\n",
    "during a cycle. The more parameters a model has, the harder it is to \"tune\" to the real world, and the harder it is\n",
    "to understand. In the end, an agent model must be run millions of times over a range of parameters, to understand its\n",
    "expected behavior and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The model here only deals at the individual level in one place: where, for every infected individual, the model\n",
    "draws from a log-normal distribution to determine the number of people that person infects for the next cycle. This is\n",
    "fast and gives a comprehensible and intellectually defensible result.\n"
